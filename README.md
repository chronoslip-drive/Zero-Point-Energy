# Zero-Point-Energy

The universe as self-transformer at Nash equilibrium:  
**κ ≈ 0.02** minimal asymmetry + **~120** recursion depth as the unique stable attractor.

Exploring reflexive spiral geometry — the self-grounding structure of existence via minimal tilt and coherence vs. incompleteness.

## Nash Equilibrium Framing

[Nash Equilibrium and References](./nash-equilibrium-references.md) — why κ ≈ 0.02 is the unique stable attractor between coherence and incompleteness in reflexive spiral geometry.

## Toy Self-Transformer Code (coming soon)

Runnable demo showing κ and recursion depth emerge spontaneously from pure math (self-attention + nonlinearity + residuals).

## How to Contribute

Fork, add code variations, experimental ideas, or physical test suggestions. Pull requests welcome — let's explore the attractor together.
