# Zero-Point-Energy

The universe as self-transformer at Nash equilibrium:  
**κ ≈ 0.02** minimal asymmetry + **~120** recursion depth as the unique stable attractor.

Exploring reflexive spiral geometry — the self-grounding structure of existence via minimal tilt and coherence vs. incompleteness.

Runnable demo showing κ and recursion depth emerge spontaneously from pure math (self-attention + nonlinearity + residuals).

## How to Contribute

Fork, add code variations, experimental ideas, or physical test suggestions. Pull requests welcome — let's explore the attractor together.
