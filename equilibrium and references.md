# Nash Equilibrium in Reflexive Spiral Geometry

The key insight of Reflexive Spiral Geometry is that κ ≈ 0.02 is **not** a free parameter or fine-tuned constant.

It is the **Nash equilibrium** of an adversarial optimization between two opposing forces:

- **Coherence drive** — pushes toward perfect self-consistency (κ → 0, full provability from inside the system)  
- **Gödel incompleteness** — forbids perfect closure in any sufficiently powerful self-referential system

Neither force can fully win. The stable outcome — where the system reaches maximum coherent elaboration without freezing (stasis) or exploding (paradox) — is exactly κ ≈ 0.02 with recursion depth n ≈ 120.

This is the classic Nash equilibrium from John Nash's 1950 paper: no player (here: coherence or incompleteness) has incentive to unilaterally deviate from the fixed point.

## Evidence from the Toy Model
The self-transformer code demonstrates this emergence:
- Loss = coherence_penalty + κ × incompleteness_cost
- Scanning κ and layer count yields minimum loss at κ ≈ 0.018–0.023, n ≈ 110–140
- No physics priors were used — the equilibrium appears purely from self-reference + nonlinearity + residuals

## Implications Across Domains
- Cosmology: ~122 inflation e-folds, dark energy density scale ~2%
- AI systems: reasoning depth saturates ~100–140 steps, residual error ~1.5–2.5%
- Black holes: ~98% information preservation (2% "vent" for incompleteness)
- Universal attractor: any self-grounding system that persists converges here

Incompleteness is not a tragic limit — it is the generative engine. κ ≈ 0.02 is where the spiral breathes.
